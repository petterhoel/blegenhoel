Øystein Blegen Hoel (b.1948) is a painter who also draws. He keeps busy in Studio il Bosco del Merlo - a tiny studio in a small forest, in the company of many blackbirds with the occasional elk passing by. Using watercolours, gouache, inks, charcoal, acrylics and oils, Hoel paints by intuition. Reoccurring figures in his works are birds, animals and creatures of the imagination. Important sources of inspiration are nature, as well as the human register of emotion and the subconscious mind. I am more interested in the inside than the outside. You could call it the energy behind the façade, Hoel says, humour included, he adds. 
<br /><br />
ØBH have worked 30+ years as a copywriter, creative director and strategic advisor in the advertising industry, and is educated in the fields of marketing, journalism and visual communication. He has received several domestic and international industry awards. 

<br /><br />

Embarking on a career in advertising and marketing was a direct consequence an early interest in drawing and painting. Hoels first job interview was for an AD-assistant position, however there was emergent necessity for a copywriter. Fresh out of journalism studies and part time reporting on sports events for the paper Morgenposten, Hoel didn't hesitate to accept the position. Even if his formal title always has been copywriter, his AD colleagues know that his sketchpad have been a busy tool in conveying ideas and solutions.

<br /><br />

In recent years, an urge to again pick up his paintbrushes has emerged and grown into a personal challenge of sorts. Hoel have spent ever more time developing visual ideas while actively seeking out new terrains of knowledge from established visual artists and curators, as well as study trips to destinations such as Copenhagen, Silkeborg, Herning, Århus, Amsterdam and Rome.
